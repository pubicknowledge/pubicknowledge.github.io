## The “Significant Objects” Experiment

## Overview

- **Experiment**: Rob Walker (a journalist) and Joshua Glenn (a writer and editor) conducted an experiment called “Significant Objects.” They bought inexpensive items—often small trinkets or knickknacks—for a total of about $250.  

- **Method**: They asked over 200 contributing writers to craft short, fictional stories about each object. These stories were then included in the items’ descriptions when put up for auction online.  

- **Result**: Many of these ordinary items sold for far more than their original price. Collectively, the items purchased for $250 sold for over $8,000. This dramatic markup highlights the power of narrative in shaping consumer perception.

## Why It Matters

1. **Emotional Connection**  

   - By giving each item a unique backstory—whether humorous, poignant, or mysterious—the project tapped into buyers’ emotions, making them see the objects as more than mere curios.

2. **Illustrates Perceived Value**  

   - The experiment demonstrates that perceived value isn’t just about material worth or brand; it’s also about the story surrounding a product.

3. **Implications for Design and Marketing**  

   - For anyone involved in branding, marketing, or user experience, this provides a case study in how powerful narratives can sway decision-making and willingness to pay.

- **Collected Stories**: The project eventually compiled many of the fictional backstories into a book, showcasing the effectiveness of storytelling in commerce.

- **Influence**: Marketers, UX designers, and storytellers often cite it as a prime example of how narrative can drive engagement and value.

## Key Takeaway

“Storytelling has a 30X Return on Investment” underscores the idea that a compelling narrative can imbue even mundane things with heightened value, proving that in many fields—especially design—the story you tell can be just as important as the product itself.

The Pudding explains ideas debated in culture with visual essays. Some of the most complex, debated topics get lost in “too long; didn’t read” 10,000-word articles. Visual storytelling makes ideas more accessible—or so goes the adage “a picture is worth a thousand words.”
