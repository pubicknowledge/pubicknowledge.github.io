### A Week in Data

Track personal habits (sleep, screen time, food intake, mood) and use what you learnt about data visualisation to create a data story that represents your lifestyle. Try and track at least 2 things and see if you can find any interesting ways to link and visualise the information.

The output can be an infographic style poster, a blog post, a video, or something else.

### Submission format

A 3 minute class presentation on 11 Feb (Tuesday)

OR

An email to gyanlakhwani@gmail.com by 14 Feb (Friday)

- You team of 1-3 people
- What do you want to visualise?
- Why do you want to visualise it?
- What would be the title for your project?
- Where will you find the data? Will you capture it yourself, or is it available somewhere?
- Is it an exploratory or explanatory visualisation?
- What tools would you use?
- What will your output format be?

I will give you some pointers on things you could look into or clarify. If I feel the project is either too ambitious or not ambitious enough I may ask you to consider changing the scope. However, this is your project and it is up to you to decide what you work on and submit.

### Alternate project ideas

**11 Feb update:** I felt some of these might be ambitious for midsems so I have moved them down. You can still do them for midsems if you want, or park the idea for endsem projects.

**Participatory data visualisation**
Set up a system where people can come and add to your visualisation. This could look like a desk with some materials and some instructions on how to add to the visualisation.
Example: [The Mood Test \| Domestic Data Streamers](https://www.domesticstreamers.com/art-research/work/the-mood-test/)

**Multimedia data visualisation**
Convert a dataset (weather, stock market, public sentiment) into an unexpected format like musical notes, rhythms, lights, vibrations or motion.
Ask people to describe their dreams and use AI-generated images and motion graphics to form dream trend visualizations (e.g., common themes like flying, falling, being chased).
Example: [Play a Kandinsky â€” Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/play-a-kandinsky/sgF5ivv105ukhA?hl=en)

**Study a trend**
Try and study a trend using social media to capture data.
What are the most common hand gestures in dance trends?
How many posts accidentally capture a pet in the background?
What are the photos people take at some popular spots?

**Analyse longform text**
Find a body of text data - say the lyrics to all the songs of your favorite artist, or all of the SMSes you receive. Come up with ways to analyse this text - like which words are used a lot, who sends more messages, etc. Use NLP tools or try and get ChatGPT to write some code to do this for you. How would you visualise this data?

The [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org) holds the [Information is Beautiful Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/) and hosts a number of regular challenges. Their [Awards Showcase](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?action=index&award=2023&controller=showcase&page=1&pcategory=winner&type=awards) lists out participants and winners, and is a great resource to find interesting data viz projects.
