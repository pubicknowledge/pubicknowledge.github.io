# Detailed Structure

#### Data and Information
- Data
- Information
- What can we do with data?
- Forming insights
- Data to Information

#### Data Models
- Structured and unstructured data
- Semi-structured data
- Examples of both
- Structured data - levels of measurement
#### Exploring Structured data
- Dimensions in data
- Basic Stats
- Spreadsheets for exploring data
- Identifying outliers and trends
- Simple visualisations inside spreadsheets
- Measures of central tendency - mean, median, mode
- Frequency
- Exploratory Data Analysis - Techniques like box plots, histograms, scatter plots to uncover insights.

#### Image models
- Raster and vector images
- What are images made of?
- Time spent on campus - Rasagy's map of entry, exit
- Sky maps over covid

#### Text models
- Qualitative vs. quantitative aspects (word counts, context, sentiment).
- Challenges of analyzing unstructured text.
- Word clouds, phrase nets, topic modeling visualizations
- Leveraging NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques for deeper insights.
#### Graphical Perception
- Data-ink ratio
- Role of aesthetics, clarity, and function in effective visuals.
- Gestalt principles
- Minimizing visual clutter and maximizing information density
- Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, Proximity
- Accuracy of Different Chart Types - Cleveland and McGill studies on how people interpret lengths, angles, and areas.
- **Visual Encoding:** Color, Shape, Size
- Color wheels, complementary, analogous, triadic color schemes.
- Color for cartography
- Perceptual aspects of color (simultaneous contrast, color blindness considerations).
- **Visual Design:** Typography, Spacing, Emphasis
- Plane graphic
- Negative space

#### Infographics
- What separates illustrations from infographics?
#### Making Good Charts

- **Tufte: Data-ink ratio**
- Ben Schneiderman’s Visualization Mantra: “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand.”

- How structure influences the visualization form
- tree diagrams, node-link diagrams
- Bar, line, pie, scatter plots, etc.
#### Lying with Data // Data and Truth
- What can be measured? Literacy rate - what is literate?
- Rich people by state - tax returns >1cr
- Ethics in Data Visualisation
- [Photo quiz: This is an experiment about how we view history](https://pudding.cool/2020/10/photo-history/)
- Data bias - where can it come from
- Histories - data x design, staged photographs
- Misleading graphics
- Common fallacies
- Spurious correlations
#### Storytelling with data
