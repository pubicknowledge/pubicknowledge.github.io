### A Week in Data

Track personal habits (sleep, screen time, food intake, mood) and use what you learnt about data visualisation to create a data story that represents your lifestyle. Try and track at least 2 things and see if you can find any interesting ways to link and visualise the information.

The output can be an infographic style poster, a blog post, a video, or something else.

### Project Plan Submission - Due 24 Feb 2025

The project plan doc should be submitted in the Google Drive folder by 11:59 PM on Monday, 24 Feb 2025.

Create a folder in [Midsem Project - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AEVKhnQK-WMWhsO1V8vo5m-fOv9oPJpW?usp=drive_link) with the name of all team members. Create a Google Doc with the following details:

- Your team of 1-3 people with Roll numbers.
- What do you want to visualise?
- Why do you want to visualise it?
- What would be the title for your project?
- Where will you find the data? Will you record it yourself, or is it available somewhere?
- Is it an exploratory or explanatory visualisation?
- What tools would you use?
- What will your output format be?

I will give you some pointers on things you could look into or clarify. If I feel the project is either too ambitious or not ambitious enough I may ask you to consider changing the scope.

### Project Submission - Due 10 March 2025

The final project files should be submitted in the Google Drive folder by 11:59 PM on Monday, 10 March 2025. The visualisation should be self-explanatory, there will be no presentations for the project.

Use the same [Midsem Project - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AEVKhnQK-WMWhsO1V8vo5m-fOv9oPJpW?usp=drive_link) folder and add your project files. If your project is online somewhere else, add a link in a Google Doc so I can open it. Please ensure that the required access is granted to gyanlakhwani@gmail.com

### Alternate project ideas

**11 Feb update:** I felt some of the other options might be ambitious for midsems so I have removed them from this page. You can try and still do them for midsems if you want, or park the idea for endsem projects.
