## Data Visualization Course Grading Plan

### Assessment and Grading Breakdown

Your performance in this course will be evaluated across 6 components, each designed to assess your participation, understanding, and practical application of data visualization concepts discussed in the class.

| #   | Component                          | Weightage (%) |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Attendance and Class Participation | 10%           |
| 2   | Class Activities and Presentations | 30%           |
| 3   | Midsem Project                     | 20%           |
| 4   | Midsem Exam                        | 5%            |
| 5   | Final Project                      | 30%           |
| 6   | Final Exam                         | 5%            |

#### 1. Attendance and Class Participation (10%)

Attendance reflects your consistent engagement with the course and is recorded for both the Morning Session (10:00 AM - 12:30 PM) and the Afternoon Session (1:30 PM - 3:30 PM) each Tuesday.

- Attendance cut-off times: 10:30 AM for the morning session and 1:30 PM for the afternoon session.

I have an open door policy and if you need to take a break or leave, feel free to do so. The penalty is that you don't get the attendance credit and don't learn from the material. No distinction is made between excused and unexcused absences. Late arrivals will not receive attendance credit but can still participate in class activities.

#### 2. Class Exercises and Presentations (30%)

Throughout the course, you will do in-class activities and deliver presentations about tools, techniques, and your own work during the course.

- You will present visualizations, techniques, and analyses related to course content during designated weeks, showcasing your ability to communicate data insights effectively.

- Your top 6 scores will be averaged to determine your grade. Each presentation will be graded on a 5-point system.

| Facets                 | Maximum Points | Evaluation Description                                                                                          |

| Presentation Skills    | 1              | Clarity, confidence, and audience engagement.                                                                   |

| Time Management        | 1              | Staying within time limits while covering all key points. Taking too little time or too much time are both bad. |

#### 3. Midsem Project (20%)

The midterm project is a group project, and focuses on exploratory data visualization.

Team projects, of course, encourage collaboration. You are encouraged to work together on all parts of the project, and must ensure that every team member is involved in all aspects of the project (design, coding, and documentation). Although the team will receive a single grade, each team member will be asked to identify their own work product to ensure equitable division of labor.
