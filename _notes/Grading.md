## Data Visualization Course Grading Plan

### Assessment and Grading Breakdown

Your performance in this course will be evaluated across the following components, each designed to assess your participation, understanding, and practical application of data visualization concepts discussed in the class.

| #   | Component                          | Weightage (%) |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Attendance and Class Participation | 10%           |
| 2   | Class Exercises                    | 40%           |
| 3   | Midsem Project                     | 20%           |
| 4   | Midsem Exam                        | 5%            |
| 5   | Final Project                      | 20%           |
| 6   | Final Exam                         | 5%            |

#### 1. Attendance and Class Participation (10%)

Attendance reflects your consistent engagement with the course and is recorded for both the Morning Session (10:00 AM - 12:30 PM) and the Afternoon Session (1:30 PM - 3:30 PM) each Tuesday.

- Attendance cut-off times: 10:30 AM for the morning session and 1:30 PM for the afternoon session.

I have an open door policy and if you need to take a break or leave, feel free to do so. The penalty is that you don't get the attendance credit and don't learn from the material. No distinction is made between excused and unexcused absences. Late arrivals will not receive attendance credit but can still participate in class activities.

#### 2. Class Exercises (40%)

Throughout the course, you will do in-class activities and deliver presentations about tools, techniques, and your own work during the course.

- You will present visualizations, techniques, and analyses related to course content during designated weeks, showcasing your ability to communicate data insights effectively.

- Your top 5 scores will be averaged to determine your grade. Each presentation will be evaluated on the basis of Content Quality, Creativity/Originality, Presentation Skills, Time Management, Audience Interaction, etc. as applicable.

I will grade each of these projects out of 8 and consider the best 5 scores.

1. [[Exercise - Data Visualisation Tools]]
2. [[Exercise - Data Selfie]]
3. [[Exercise - Three Ways of Visualising]]
4. [[Exercise - Critique and Redesign]]
5. [[Exercise - Self Visualising Information]]
6. [[Exercise - Style a Map]]
7. [[Exercise - Schematic Maps]]

#### 3. Midsem Project (20%)

The midterm project is a group project (groups up to 3). See [[Project - Midsem Project]].

Team projects encourage collaboration. You should work together on all parts of the project, and should ensure that every team member is involved in all aspects of the project. The team will receive a single grade.
