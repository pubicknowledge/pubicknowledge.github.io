### Option 1 - Expand on your midsem project

If you felt there was more you could do with your midsem project, continue to work on it. Grading will take into account work already done for the midsem and you will be graded on the additional work you do on the endsem project.

### Option 2 - Data Experiences

Create a data art piece or new media installation or interactive way to experience data.

### Option 3 - New Self Initiated Project

If you want to do something else, talk to me about your project idea by 8 April 2025.

### In-person Project Presentations - 22 April 2025

The final project files should be submitted in the Google Drive folder by 11:59 PM on Monday, 21 March 2025. There will be an in-person presentation the next day in class on 22 April 2025.
