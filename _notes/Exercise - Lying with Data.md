title: "Exercise - Lying with Data"

### Reference Material

See [[Which Chart to Use]] for a list of reference material that show the different types of data and the types of charts that can be used to represent them.

### Instructions

Create one visualization that purposefully misrepresents a data message and contrast it with a correct and unbiased visualization of the same data. Employ one or more perceptual principles or use other techniques to create “charts that lie.” You may treat this as a data art assignment wherein the aesthetics of the visual illusion is the primary goal; take for inspiration [Josef Albers](https://acpress.amherst.edu/books/intersectingcolors/chapter/josef-albers-and-the-science-of-seeing/), [MC Escher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty1twivydVA), [optical illusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_illusion), etc.

Alternatively, design a news-style or marketing graphic that has been manipulated, e.g. [Steve Job’s pie chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hsCzdE5F5RTOT8HEsHd34xBkrDXhNX_RsaMXHAHjjKQ/edit#slide=id.g508582c814_0_346) or [this chart on gun deaths](https://www.livescience.com/45083-misleading-gun-death-chart.html). Either way, your visualization must be based on real data (however simple), and the visual princples you use (or disobey) to create the misrepresentation should be more sophisticated than e.g. missing axis labels, [dual axes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NeXfD4yF50x3U2UPXtcbLNYB78o=/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost/public/LWPXZOFVXBDGPNGIUQGCNVFDMA.png), or [not mapping ink to values](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hsCzdE5F5RTOT8HEsHd34xBkrDXhNX_RsaMXHAHjjKQ/edit#slide=id.gbecdbfaef3_0_217). Submit as slides or PDF with your images and a paragraph or two describing your approach.

### Submission format

Upto 5 minute presentation with:

- A link to the data story along with 3/4 key points that it makes.
- The visualisation(s) in the story that you want to redesign
- Issues identified with the existing visualisation
- Your redesigned visualisation
- What did you change? How is it better now?

### FAQ

**I can't figure out where the article sourced the data from. What do I do?**

If you can back-calculate the data values from the chart, you can do that. If there are too many values and you feel like you'll spend too much time doing that, look for another story.

**Can I use a source other than the two listed here?**

Yes, but make sure it's a data journalism piece that is using data to tell a story or explain something.
