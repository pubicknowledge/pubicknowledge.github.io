**Participatory data visualisation**
Set up a system where people can come and add to your visualisation. This could look like a desk with some materials and some instructions on how to add to the visualisation.
Example: [The Mood Test \| Domestic Data Streamers](https://www.domesticstreamers.com/art-research/work/the-mood-test/)

**Multimedia data visualisation**
Convert a dataset (weather, stock market, public sentiment) into an unexpected format like musical notes, rhythms, lights, vibrations or motion.
Ask people to describe their dreams and use AI-generated images and motion graphics to form dream trend visualizations (e.g., common themes like flying, falling, being chased).
Example: [Play a Kandinsky â€” Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/play-a-kandinsky/sgF5ivv105ukhA?hl=en)

**Study a trend**
Try and study a trend using social media to capture data.
What are the most common hand gestures in dance trends?
How many posts accidentally capture a pet in the background?
What are the photos people take at some popular spots?

**Analyse longform text**
Find a body of text data - say the lyrics to all the songs of your favorite artist, or all of the SMSes you receive. Come up with ways to analyse this text - like which words are used a lot, who sends more messages, etc. Use NLP tools or try and get ChatGPT to write some code to do this for you. How would you visualise this data?
