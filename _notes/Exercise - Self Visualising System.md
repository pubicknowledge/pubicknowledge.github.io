title: "Exercise - Self Visualising System"
---

Data doesn’t always need to be collected and processed to be seen—it often visualises itself in the physical world. By observing our surroundings, we can uncover naturally occurring data visualisations that tell stories of use, behavior, and change over time.

### Instructions

Find and photograph a _self-visualising system_—a physical phenomenon that reveals patterns of human activity, environmental forces, or time. Consider examples such as:

- The cross-section of a tree trunk, where rings indicate age and climate patterns.

- Worn-out paths in grass or dirt, showing the most frequently traveled routes.

- The smooth, shiny surfaces of frequently touched statues, door handles, or stair railings.

- Residue, rust, or discoloration on walls or floors where water consistently flows.

Think about how these patterns _naturally encode_ information. What behaviors or forces led to these marks? What story does the visualization tell?

### Submission format

Submit a Google Doc containing:

1. **At least one photo** (more if you find multiple examples) of a self-visualising system in your environment.

2. **A 250+ word reflection** answering the following questions:

- What is the subject of your photo?
- What information does this visualization reveal?
- What's the story that it tells? How do human behavior or natural forces contribute to this pattern?
- How might this type of visualization inspire digital or interactive data visualisation?
