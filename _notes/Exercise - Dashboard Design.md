### Paste this into ChatGPT or another AI model

Act as the client of a data analytics firm. My firm will conduct an analysis and derive insights through data visualization. As the client, please provide me with the following for my analysis:

Industry: Specify the industry in which your company operates. Be creative!

Data: Provide data in an .csv format from a department within your company. Include as many columns and rows as you wish. Please ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis, as this is a dashboard design exercise, not a data cleaning exercise.

Business Objectives: Describe the overall objectives of your business and the specific objectives of the department from which you are providing data.

Data Explanation: Offer a detailed explanation of the data columns in your spreadsheet to provide context for the analysis.

Desired Insights: Specify the specific insights or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you want me to derive from your data.

### Step 1 - Sketch and Ideate

Use pen and paper to try and plan out possible ways of visualising the data. Keep in mind the Who, What, Why, When for the dashboard.

### Step 2 - Design

Digitally create the dashboard either in a data visualisation tool, or mockups using Figma or another design tool.

### Submission Format

A 5 minute presentation about your dashboard with your understanding of the who, what, why, when. Your ideation, and your final dashboard.
