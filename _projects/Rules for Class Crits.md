- Keep feedback respectful and focused on the work, not the person. We’re all here to learn.
- If you liked something, call it out! If you don’t, try and explain why.
- You can use “I wonder…” or “Have you considered…?” to open discussions.
- You can and should build on each other’s ideas, but let people finish their thought and avoid interruptions.
- Understand that choices are made based on available data, audience, and format limitations. What were the tradeoffs involved?
