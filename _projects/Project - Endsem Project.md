title: "Project - Endsem Project"
---

Expected time available to work on this project is about 2 weeks, so the scope for the project is similiar to Midsem projects.

### Option 1 - Expand on your midsem project

If you felt there was more you could have done with your midsem project, continue to work on it. Grading will take into account work already done for the midsem and you will be graded on the additional work you do on the endsem project.

### Option 2 - Data Experiences

Create an immersive or emotionally resonant data art piece or new media installation or interactive way to experience data. Your goal is not to inform users through graphs, but to make them **feel**, **interact**, or **reflect** on data in a new way.

Some things you could try are: data sonification, physical installation, speculative design, projection mapping, etc. The goal is not technical perfection but evocative storytelling through data.

### Option 3 - New Self Initiated Project

If you want to do something else, talk to me about your project idea by 8 April 2025. Feel free to message or email me earlier if you want to get started earlier.

### In-person Project Presentations - 22 April 2025

The final project files should be submitted in the Google Drive folder by 11:59 PM on Monday, 21 March 2025. There will be an in-person presentation the next day in class on Tuesday, 22 April 2025.
