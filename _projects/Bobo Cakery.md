Bobo's USP is their ability to make the cake you want. How could we guide users to select their dream cake?

We began by mapping out the key offerings of Bobo Cakery—standard designs, decor cakes, and fully custom cakes. To reduce friction and protect the team’s bandwidth, we designed a flow that directed low-ticket inquiries to the website while allowing premium custom orders to go through a WhatsApp consultation.

The website introduces the brand through rich visuals and an editorial layout that blends storytelling with clear calls-to-action. We used playful typographic accents and soft color schemes to echo the tone of a premium but friendly cakery.

From a UX standpoint, the goal was clarity and containment: ensuring users knew what was available, what the process was, and what to expect. This meant clear tiering of product types, up-front pricing indicators, and contextual guidance embedded in the order flow.

In the backend, the bakery team uses Shopify for fulfillment. We helped streamline their product architecture, adjusted theme code to improve speed, and optimized the CMS setup so the team could easily update offerings without technical support.

The end result is a brand-forward e-commerce site that scales the custom cake consultation process without sacrificing the personal touch Bobo is known for.
