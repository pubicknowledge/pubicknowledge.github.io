"Listen for Therapists" is an application designed for therapists to enhance their professional skills through AI technology. 

The app allows therapists to record therapy sessions and automatically transcribes them, providing detailed reports that analyze the session.

This enables therapists to gain a deeper understanding of their interactions with clients and refine their therapeutic techniques accordingly. "Listen for Therapists" serves as a tool not just for session documentation but as a means to foster a more effective and empathetic approach to therapy, helping therapists adapt their methods to better meet their clients' needs.
