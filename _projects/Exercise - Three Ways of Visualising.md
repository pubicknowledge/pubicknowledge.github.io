title: "Exercise - Three Ways of Visualising"
---

### Reference Material

See [[Which Chart to Use]] for a list of reference material that show the different types of visualisations and the types of charts that can be used to represent them.

### Instructions

Find a small table of data that has at least 2x3 cells of data. Use the types of visualisations listed in the Data Viz Project to find 3 different ways to visualise this data. Try and use unusual ways to represent the data, if you can come up with something that's not in the website that's a bonus.

Here are some examples of tables:

#### Streaming Service Usage by Time of Day

| **Time of Day** | **Service A** | **Service B** | **Service C** |

| Evening         | 400 users     | 290 users     | 240 users     |

#### Average Test Scores by Subject and Class

| **Class** | **Math** | **Science** | **History** |
| --------- | -------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| Class A   |       78 |          85 |          90 |
| Class B   |       88 |          79 |          92 |
| Class C   |       71 |          83 |          88 |

#### Seasonal Temperatures in 4 Cities

| **Season** | **City A** | **City B** | **City C** | City D |
| ---------- | ---------: | ---------: | ---------: | ------ |

| Summer     |       24°C |       29°C |       19°C | 24°C   |

### Submission format

3 minute presentation with:

- Your table of data along with the source, and [[Levels of Measurement]] identified
- 3 Visualisations with [[Marks and Channels]] for each
- Any interesting takeaways in finding the data, creating the visualisation, or choices of visualisation.

If you are struggling with digital tools, you can:

- Partly generate the chart with Google Sheets/Excel/etc. and then take it into Figma/Photoshop to add things on top of it
- Draw it on paper
