Delivered a visual and strategic overhaul of EBC Reader, introducing LLM capabilities and enhancing content discovery for legal professionals.

We collaborated with the internal product team at EBC to reimagine their web-based legal research tool used by lawyers, law students, and judges. The goal was to modernize the user experience and integrate new AI capabilities, while retaining the reliability and depth that long-time users relied on.

Key UX improvements included simplifying the navigation structure, reducing cognitive load in dense reading environments, and introducing contextual filters to make legal content easier to browse. We crafted a design system rooted in legibility and trust, optimizing for both long-form reading and search workflows.

Our integration of large language models (LLMs) allowed the reader to offer smart summarization, precedent suggestions, and topic overviewsâ€”transforming how users engage with legal texts. These AI tools were surfaced subtly, ensuring they supported rather than distracted from the core experience.

The project concluded with a series of workshops to align the new design with internal engineering constraints and help the team plan phased rollout. The result is a significantly more intuitive and forward-facing legal research experience.
