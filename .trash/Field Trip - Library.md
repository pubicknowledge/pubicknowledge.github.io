### Preparation

Install the [Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) app and download the North Indian birds pack. This may be around .5 GB so it's best to do it in advance when you have good internet. Their Sound ID feature listens to the birds around you and shows real-time suggestions for who’s singing. You can also identify birds by photo.
