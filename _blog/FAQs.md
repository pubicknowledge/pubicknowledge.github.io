### How much experience do you have doing this?

Public Knowledge started in 2024, but our small team brings years of combined experience in the field of User Interfaces, User Research, Product Strategy, Art Direction and Illustration. See more about the people who make up Public Knowledge on our People page.

### Will you code what you design?

No. Weâ€™re a small team and we focus on what we do best. We may be able to recommend an external developer and work with them on project handoff.
