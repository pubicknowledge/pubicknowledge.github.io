#### Be Excellent to Each Other (and yourself!)

People remember how they felt more than what happened. Be kind to others. Be kind to yourself. Give yourself the same leeway you grant to others.

#### Doodle License Granted

Here’s your license to scribble outside the lines. Experiment, innovate, disrupt. Be a nuisance to the status quo.

#### Own your work

You can just do things! If you have an itch to try something, scratch it. If something feels broken to you, do what it takes to fix it. Leave things better than you found them.

#### Feedback is a Gift

Receiving actionable advice from others is beneficial. Listen openly without getting defensive, note things down, and evaluate the feedback later.

#### Give Away Your Legos

Did a great job? Brace yourself for more! Hand off your current blocks (tasks) to build even bigger ones.

#### Stay Curious

Ask questions. Always be on the lookout for a chance to learn something and do something new.

#### Teamwork makes the dream work

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. Together, we make magic happen.

#### Market yourself as yourself

Let your marketing reflect your personality to attract clients who will enjoy working with you.

#### Reflexivity

Oops? No problem! Things are bound to go wrong. When they do, every misstep is a new dance move you’ve just learned. Keep grooving and growing.

#### Radical Service

How you can serve people exceptionally well. What is a standard practice that doesn’t have to be standard?
