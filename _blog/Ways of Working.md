## Radical Service

How can you serve people exceptionally well? What is a standard practice that can be better? Always leave things better than you found them.

## Own your work

You can just do things! If you have an itch to try something, scratch it. If something feels broken to you, do what it takes to fix it.

## Stay Curious

Ask questions. Always be on the lookout for a chance to learn something and do something new.

## Give Away Your Legos

Did a great job? Brace yourself for more! Hand off your current blocks (tasks) to build even bigger ones.

## Feedback is a Gift

Receiving actionable advice from others is beneficial. Listen openly without getting defensive, note things down, and evaluate the feedback later.

## Reflexivity

Oopsie, made a whoopsie? Don't panic! Things are bound to go wrong. When they do, own up to it, and figure out what you could do to avoid being in the same position again.

## Be Excellent to Each Other (and yourself!)

People remember how they felt more than the details of what happened. Be kind to others. Be kind to yourself. Give yourself the same leeway you grant to others.

## We, not I

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. Together, we make magic happen.

## Market yourself

Let your marketing reflect your personality to attract clients who will enjoy working with you.

## Doodle License Granted

Hereâ€™s your license to scribble outside the lines. Experiment, innovate, disrupt. Be a nuisance to the status quo.
