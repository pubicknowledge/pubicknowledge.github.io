title: "Keep the Web Weird - Design Degree Showcase, IIT Delhi"
---

DDS is the Annual Design Degree Showcase at the Department of Design, IIT Delhi. Charu and I conducted a workshop that talked about how we’ve adopted AI tools into our workflows, and some suggestions for how to avoid the cookie-cutter responses you’ll get from LLMs unless you are specific enough with your prompts.
